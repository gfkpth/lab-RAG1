Maybe somewhat surprisingly, the English-type pattern where nominal person is re-
stricted to participant-denoting APCs is only attested in 8 genera, while the pattern without
person restrictions is found in 22, or even 29 if we include the All? category. I disregard the
group of languages where demonstratives are used as third person pronouns for the reasons
discussed regarding Table 2.27 on page 87.

Delorme & Dougherty 1972), German (Rauh 2004) or Japanese (Furuya 2008, Inokuma 2009)
with occasional reference to a general, maybe even universal tendency for such a number
asymmetry, see in particular Pesetsky (1978).59 Of course, German data like (141) show that
singular APCs are not universally ruled out.

or non-participant in any speech context. Maybe Portuguese a gente ‘the people’ in its first
person plural use (Costa & Pereira 2013) could be viewed as such a case, but the scarcity of
the phenomenon does not seem very surprising.
Finally, much of this thesis is devoted to showing that, contrary to Ackema & Neeleman’s
claim in (344c), overt person marking on DPs is actually attested. Apart from the proposal
that APCs like English we linguists represent a productive means of nominal person marking,
the languages described in chapter 2 section 2.3.4 as having clitic or affixal person marking
may represent even clearer examples of languages that “spell-out [. . . ] person features on
R-expressions”. In conclusion, the criticism directed at hidden feature accounts does not seem
to be sufficient to dismiss it.
The main difference between the hidden feature proposals in the literature is where the
person features of the unagreeing subject are located: on the same head as the definite article
(Saab 2007, 2013), on a head distinct from it (Stavrou 1995; see also this chapter and Höhn
2016), or on a phrasal constituent in SpecDP (Choi 2013, 2014b).

(38) If a language has singular APCs, it also has non-singular APCs.
The chapter is structured as follows. In section 2.1, I present the database and some
methodological and analytical issues that arose in collecting the data. Section 2.2 comments on
languages without APCs, while section 2.3 discusses the word order tendencies summarised
above in more detail. Instances of another type of person marking, namely an enclitic or
affixal morpheme at the periphery of the nominal domain, will be reviewed in section 2.3.4.
The distribution of articles and demonstrative pronouns with respect to APCs is discussed
in sections 2.4 and 2.5 respectively. Section 2.6 is concerned with crosslinguistic variation in
the permissible person and number specifications in APCs, providing the empirical basis for
the generalisations above. Finally, section 2.7 summarises the findings of this chapter.

Non-possessive person marking, including the phenomenon of APCs, is rarely discussed in
grammatical descriptions. A notable exception are grammars in the Routledge Descriptive

2.2 Absence of APCs
Most languages in the survey show some form of non-possessive nominal person marking,
partly owing to the sampling method as discussed above. However, there is a small number
of languages for which I have not been able to get relevant data and to establish the existence
or lack of APCs or similar devices. They are listed in (42).
(42) Rapanui (Austronesian)
Madurese (Austronesian)
Vaeakau-Taumako (Austronesian)
Teiwa (TNG)
Although the main criterion for inclusion in the sample was the availability of information
on non-possessive nominal person marking, Rapanui was included for largest possible cover-
age of the Routledge Descriptive Grammar series and the latter three languages due to their
relevance to the discussion of PPDCs in section 2.5. As discussed in section 2.1.1, absence of
relevant information does not mean that these languages lack APCs (or some other form of
nominal person marking).
Similar considerations apply to the five languages listed in (43), which have clitic markers
of nominal person as discussed in section 2.3.4. While I have no information concerning

2.1.2 Overview
This survey is based on a total of 92 languages, with data mostly drawn from published
grammars and in a smaller number of cases elicited from native-speaker consultants. A list
of these languages is given in Table 2.1, including their genetic affiliation. They are grouped
by linguistic family or common terms of convenience. Where published grammars were used
as a significant source, the relevant references are indicated in the third column. For ease
of identification, grammars based on Comrie & Smith’s (1977) questionnaire are marked by
(C).4 A sketch of the location of the languages for which map coordinates were available is
provided in Figure 2.1.5

nominal person marking.In Basque, Bilua and Khoekhoe the person markers are quite clearly
phrasal suffixes, or enclitics, and the same probably holds for the Gorokan languages. The
available data are insufficient to determine this for Alamblak.
Basque, Bilua, Yagaria, Fore and Khoekhoe appear to show prenominal pronouns in addi-
tion to clitic person marking, but only Basque and Bilua show cases of simultaneous marking
by adnominal pronouns and person enclitics. As discussed below in section 2.3.4.5, contrary
to superficial appearances the “pronominal stems” in Khoekhoe are probably better analysed
as a type of article (Haacke 1976, 1977) than as prenominal pronouns.
Bilua and Khoekhoe provide rare examples of languages with person agreement within
the noun phrase – Bilua by means of (impoverished) person marking on modifier phrases, cf.
example (76), Khoekhoe through the person-sensitive NP-initial determiners just mentioned.
Most languages with clitic person-marking are verb-final, with the exception of Classical
Nahuatl, where basic word order is hard to establish due to its polysynthetic structure, and

There is no clear asymmetry concerning whether or not languages with articles also allow
or require them in APCs. About half of them do, which clearly indicates that the pronominal
determiner analysis is not universally applicable (see chapters 4 and 6). Similarly, the personal
pronoun-demonstrative constructions from section 2.5 suggest that the commonly assumed
complementary distribution of personal pronouns and demonstratives is not universal. Pos-
sible implications are discussed in chapter 7.
Finally, I have investigated variation in the person and number features that can be ex-
pressed by nominal person and proposed the following implicational universals regarding
the markedness of third person and singular in APCs.
(162) Generalisation on person in APCs:
If a language has third person APCs, it has first and second person APCs.
(163) Generalisation on number in APCs:
If a language has singular APCs, it also has non-singular APCs.
Moreover, there seems to be an interaction between the availability of third person APCs
and the presence of articles in APCs as formulated in (164).

# Languages with Rare Nominal Person Marking

Several languages exhibit rare types of nominal person marking, particularly in the context of adnominal pronoun constructions (APCs) and bound person constructions (BPCs). According to the provided survey, languages such as Basque and Bilua present rare instances where person agreement occurs within the noun phrase. In these languages, person markers function as phrasal suffixes or enclitics. Additionally, Khoekhoe exhibits a unique form of person-sensitive NP-initial determiners.

Bilua and Khoekhoe are specifically noted for having prenominal pronouns alongside clitic person marking, which is an uncommon feature across languages. Furthermore, Persian is mentioned among those that restrict APCs to non-singular forms while other languages like Mangarayi allow all persons but also have restrictions based on number.
