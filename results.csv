and what not. And it looks at issues about AI, power and inequalities, investi -

The book also brings diverse and critical voices to this debate. Whereas AI 
as a discipline has been dominated by white, male, predominantly older scien-
tists from mathematical disciplines, this collection brings perspectives that are 
characterised by a strong diversity in authorship and discipline. And threading 
through all, the contributions offer a discussion of different tangents of power 
and political economy in the field of AI and society.
The first task is to name our terms. For a concept that has been with us for so 
long, there is little consensus on how to define it. The history of debating AI is 
almost as old as AI itself. There is more debate than agreement about what AI  
is and what it is not, and the only thing generally agreed is that there is no

Introduction: Why We Need Critical Perspectives on AI  11
It is clear that we need to be aware of AI ideology and acknowledge that AI 
ethics alone, despite their value and contributions, will not save the world. The 
other problem is about how we move from AI ethics to concrete policies. There 
is no roadmap for what exactly should be done, no precise course of action to 
be taken in policy development (Coeckelbergh 2020). It comes down to who 
has the capacity to influence the actions, beliefs or behaviour of others. Or  
who can influence what type of society we want, and what the role of techno-
logy such as AI should be in it. Ultimately, this is a question about power and 
who is in control to make decisions.
We Have to Talk about AI and Power
The problem of AI ideology and – more broadly – the question of whether 
we need AI and if so, what type of AI we need, illustrates why we need criti -
cal perspectives on AI. What do I mean by critical? The Frankfurt School has

look like (Crawford 2018). Questions about inclusion and representation are 
inherently political questions. AI also refers to industrial infrastructures: the 
infrastructure does not only entail the possibilities of collecting vast amounts 
of data, but also the computational power needed to develop machine/deep 
learning models. Very few companies have simultaneously the computational 
power, access to data and AI expertise (human resources) at their disposal, 
which means that the economic power of these organisations is crucial for the 
development of AI and is highly concentrated (Dyer-Witheford, Kjøsen and 
Steinhoff 2019). 
The Case for a Radical Democratisation of AI
Asking critical questions about AI with the objective to foster human eman -
cipation requires us to investigate the political and economic power dynam -

Amidst this doom and gloom, what we desperately need is a more nuanced 
debate about AI’s risks and opportunities. This can – must – be a serious and 
informed discussion that goes beyond hyperbole and polarisation, fuelled by 
popular media and thus feeding into public debate. What we need is critical 
perspectives on AI: what it is and what it is not; what type of AI we need, what 
visions exist about this and who is behind them; and ultimately, how to think 
and talk about AI power and inequalities.
In one word, it is power that must be at the centre of our conversations about 
AI and that is what this book is about. If we want to talk about critical perspec-
tives on AI, formulating a critique on AI, how it is currently being developed 
and discussed, and yes, if we are serious about making sure that AI will benefit 
everyone, we need to talk about power. Power refers to the capacity to influ -

The Case of Artificial Intelligence
For some years now, technical solutions utilising artificial intelligence are 
widely seen as means to tackle many fundamental problems of mankind. From 
fighting the climate crisis, tackling the problems of ageing societies, reducing 
global poverty, stopping terror, detecting copyright infringements or curing 
cancer to improving evidence-based politics, improving predictive police work, 
local transportation, self-driving cars and even waste removal.
Definitions
The first step towards a meaningful discussion about AI would be to define 
what exactly one means when talking about AI. Historically there have been 
two major understandings of AI: strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence 
(AGI) and weak AI or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI). The goal of AGI is 
the creation of an artificial human like intelligence, so an AI system with true 
human-like intelligence including perception, agency, consciousness, inten -

discussion usually ignores those and therefore the range of AI-assigned func -
tionality reaches from applying traditional statistics to using machine learning 
(ML) techniques up to solely movie inspired ideas or even generally to ‘highly 
complex information systems’ , as in the official ‘ Social Principles of Human-
centric AI’ of Japan (Council for Social Principles of Human-centric AI 2019).
In the following, we will concentrate on artificial neural networks to illus -
trate the fallacies and pitfalls of questionably used language. The focus on ANN  
in this text is in line with the current debate of AI, where AI is predominantly 
used synonymously with machine learning using artificial neural networks 
(Eberl 2018). Nevertheless, the problems mentioned here also apply to debates 
concerning other forms of AI, when a similar terminology is being used.
Key drivers for the current AI renaissance are the successes of applying arti-

AI should be and what it should do. This section poses critical questions about 
how AI needs to debunk the myths surrounding it.
Part 3: AI Power and Inequalities – advances the debate around AI by criti -
cally examining what ‘ AI for Everyone?’ means. This is dealing with the root of 
the problem: who will benefit from AI is ultimately down to who has the power 
to decide. These contributions look at how AI capitalism is organised, what 
(new) inequalities it might bring about and how we can fight back.
Why do we need a book on AI for Everyone? and why do we need it now? 
The 2007–2008 financial crisis, and the resulting global economic crisis, has not 
only brought about a decade of austerity in large parts of the Western world; 
it has also been the context in which social media and digital platforms have 
transformed into behemoths. Tech companies are now dominating the top 10

sions are then reached by matching one against the other, and working out how 
each measures up. 
In other words, the rationalisation of AI is laid out in comparative terms, so 
that AI becomes intelligible only as against human capacities, or against what 
AI can or cannot do as compared to humans. The multiplicities which reflect 
this rationalisation across philosophy, computer science, cognitive psychol -
ogy, cybernetics, neuroscience and myriad other disciplines are myriad and 
intricate, and far beyond the scope of this chapter to cover comprehensively. A 
few highlights will hopefully suffice to demonstrate its contours. We might, for 
instance, think about Vannevar Bush’s famous imagining of a memory machine 
he named the ‘ memex’ (Bush 1945), influential to the present day as a basis 
for the World Wide Web (Davies 2011). Notably, Bush presented the memex

# Core Topics in AI Discussions

Some core topics in discussions about AI include the coexistence of humans and machines, the power dynamics associated with AI, and the ethical implications of its development. There is a strong focus on the need for critical perspectives to understand what type of AI we need and who benefits from it. Issues such as inclusion, representation, and economic power concentration are also central to these discussions. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on defining AI and addressing myths surrounding it.

Unveiling this myth of the ineluctability of AI and its urgency, it is impos -
sible not to recall Williams’ analysis in Towards 2000 where he stated that  
‘The sense of some new technology as inevitable or unstoppable is a product  
of the overt and covert marketing of the relevant interests’ (Williams 1985, 
133). In reality technological development is not predetermined, and alterna -
tive paths to a market-led development that reinforces the current neoliberal 
status quo are always a possibility (Brevini 2020).
Myth #3: AI Surpassing Human Intelligence
Like every institution that developed a strategy for AI, the EC also had to start 
by defining AI. The Communication of the Commission clarifies that:
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems that display intelligent 
behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions – with 
some degree of autonomy – to achieve specific goals. AI-based systems 
can be purely software-based, acting in the virtual world (e.g. voice  
assistants, image analysis, software, search engines, speech and face 
recognition systems) or AI can be embedded in hardware devices  
(e.g. advanced robots, autonomous cars, drones or Internet of Things 
applications). (European Commission 2018a, 2)
Moreover, what emerges from the EU documents is the underlying assumption 
that artificial intelligence will outperform human capabilities. In several docu-

subordination of human labour to computers. Of course, as I have discussed 
above, neoliberalism has long established a privileged relationship with tech -
nology as the ‘prime mover’ of capitalist growth (Harvey 2005).
Conclusion 
The AI myths discussed in these pages are very powerful tools for the con -
struction of a discourse that make us perceive AI as the solution to the major 
problems in our society, including the inequalities brought about by capital -
ism and other major crises such as climate change and global health emergen-
cies. Through these myths, AI then becomes the technological saviour, whose 
advent is ineluctable. As such, when the artificial machine arrives – in this 
future/present which is always inevitably imminent – it will manifest as a supe-
rior intelligence to solve the problems that capital economies have themselves 
created. Eventually, AI will outsmart humans to mend that damage and amelio-
rate further risks that capitalism inevitably occasions.
The recurrent myths that are omnipresent in the European Framework for 
AI have two major consequences. Firstly, they structure a hegemonic dis -
course that makes it impossible to think of alternative paths, framing resist -
ance as futile because technological development is predestined. Accordingly, 
they legitimise a neoliberal ideology that pushes consumerism and produc -
tivity above all values and strips technology from the social relations that are

A Useful Framework for AI or the Ghost in the Machine?
Some sixty years ago, a part of the computer science community embarked 
upon an ambitious research program named ‘artificial intelligence’ . Summar-
ily, the task at hand was to write an intelligent computer program; one that 
could simulate human thinking, and while at it, why not, properly think and 
even be conscious, just like a human. They had just realised that computers 
were able to handle arithmetical and logical operations much better than an 
ordinary human being, and a whole wide world of opportunities opened up 
before them. But after some initial effort, the researchers saw two things: the 
aim of implementing intelligence was an ill-posed problem, because there 
was no satisfactory definition of intelligence. The concept of intelligence, just 
like many defining characteristic of human beings, is normative and vague.  
The second realisation would come a little later, as it required more failures: the  
internal dynamics of many human endeavours were unknown, and misjudged. 
People thought that understanding and speaking was easy, whereas playing 
chess was difficult. Thus, chess was seen as a benchmark of intelligence. Y ears 
later, when a computer program, Deep Blue (Hsu 2002), was able to beat the 
world champion of chess, cognitive science had already contributed much

# Common Myths in Discussions About AI

Several common myths about AI are discussed in the literature:

1. **AI as an Inevitable Technological Saviour**: There is a myth that AI development is inevitable and unstoppable, which is used to promote a neoliberal agenda. This belief suggests that AI will solve major societal problems, including those created by capitalism (Brevini 2020).

2. **AI Surpassing Human Intelligence**: Another prevalent myth is that AI will surpass human intelligence and capabilities. This assumption underlies many discussions about AI, despite lacking substantial evidence or consensus (European Commission 2018a).

3. **AI as a Solution for Humanity's Challenges**: It is often suggested that AI can address humanity's biggest challenges, such as climate change and global health emergencies. However, this perception overlooks the complexities of these issues and overestimates what technology can achieve on its own (Verdegem 2020).

These myths contribute to a discourse framing technological development as predestined and undermine consideration of alternative approaches.

extension of internet connectivity into physical devices and everyday objects 
such as a refrigerator or a heater, equipped with sensors and software to collect

Machine learning, simply put, is ‘methods that help computers learn without 
being explicitly programmed’ (Kaplan and Haenlein 2019, 17), and is applied 
in order to identify underlying patterns within the big data, and as such is an 
essential element of artificial intelligence. A more elaborated definition comes 
from Mitchell (1997, 2) stating ‘ A computer program is said to learn from 
experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P  
if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.’   
AI is much broader than machine learning, as it additionally comprises such 
abilities as the perception of data (e.g., voice/image recognition, natural lan -

the varying approaches to how we define AI. 
The Origins of AI
It is easy to forget that AI has been with us for more than 60 years. Despite  
the flash of excitement and anxiety that feels so recent, AI itself is not a new  
phenomenon. The name Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined in the mid-
1950s at a series of academic workshops organised at Dartmouth College, New  
Hampshire (USA). A group of scientists, led by mathematics professor John 
McCarthy, gathered to investigate the ways in which machines could simulate 
aspects of human intelligence: the ability to learn and make decisions. Their 
core assumption was that human reasoning could be reconstructed using 
mathematical techniques and, as a consequence, problem-solving could be  
formalised into algorithms (McCarthy et al. 1955/2006).
What is more recent is a reflexive, if not critical, and social-scientific, under-
standing of not just AI’s capabilities, but its impacts on human life and social 
organisation (Elliott 2019). It took decades for AI research to move from 
what it could do for us to what it could do to us, or enable us to do to each 
other. These first critical insights came along with observations that AI can 
not only supercharge innovation and bring about economic prosperity but also  
lead to inequalities and unfairness. 
This book contributes to this debate by critically reflecting on how we  
should think about AI and the relationship between humans and machines.

course, but machine learning was produced within these structures of power 
and it is acting back on them. While the mathematics of AI may be expressed 
as matrices, it is a human activity that is inescapably immersed in history and 
culture. AI acts as an activation function for specific social tendencies. As an 
idea, or ideology, AI seeks to escape association with these worldly concerns by

potential to surpass human intellectual capacities. This can be seen as the attempt 
to mechanise human-level intelligence. Computer scientists and philosophers 
disagree on whether this is at all possible (Coeckelbergh 2020): some directly 
reject this scenario while others think if theoretically possible, it is not likely to 
happen (soon) in practice (Boden 2016). This is why it might be better to focus 
on advancements in weak AI or ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence), as this is 
the type of AI already impacting everyday life on a massive scale. Weak/nar -
row AI performs specific tasks which would normally require intelligence in a 
human being – machines aiding human thought and action. This type of AI is a 
mathematical method for prediction (Agrawal et al. 2018). Such systems can be 
extremely powerful but are limited in the range of tasks they can perform.
Russell and Norvig (2016) see machine learning as a prerequisite for intel -
ligent machines. Machine learning is a paradigm that allows programs to auto-
matically improve their performance on a particular task by learning from vast

well-being of all members of society. This means that AI development must be 
organised in such a way that all members of society are able to reap the benefits. 
Another aspect of this principle is the question about how to develop benefi -
cial machines, in other words, how can we ensure that AI serves the objectives 
of humanity. Stuart Russell (2019, 11) states: ‘machines are beneficial to the 
extent that their actions can be expected to achieve our objectives’ . According 
to him, this is at the centre of the problem of control in AI and his interpreta -
tion focuses on the human–machine relationship, as part of being beneficial to 
everyone. Developing AI that is beneficial for everyone, thus includes thinking 
about how to create beneficial machines that serve humanity. 
AI for everyone risks becoming yet another hype, if we let the tech giants 
take over the debate with their slogans such as AI for social good . What they 
are missing is a real vision of democratising technology because they fail to 
understand what AI for everyone really means: putting the human at the centre 
(Pasquale 2020). In one word, this is about power. If we are not talking about 
power, we are not talking about AI for everyone . Critical perspectives require 
us to talk about the human and society. By bringing together diverse critical 
contributions to the debate, this book presents one thing they have in common: 
the idea of putting society first.

Artificial Intelligence: Definition and Classification
Artificial intelligence is a rather fuzzy concept, and quite difficult to define. At 
least two reasons can be proposed for the difficulty in formulating a definition 
therefore: firstly, it is not easy to find a clear definition for what intelligence in 
general is, as it depends largely upon the context. Thus intelligence is described 
in several different ways such as the capacity for learning, reasoning, planning, 
understanding, critical thinking, creativity, and last but not least, problem solving.
Secondly, artificial intelligence is a moving target: advances previously con -
sidered to AI with time will not be considered as such as soon as we get used to 
them. This phenomenon is known as the AI effect. As McCordick (2004, 204) 
formulated it: ‘It’s part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that 
every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something – play 
good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems – there was cho -
rus of critics to say, “that’s not thinking” . ’ Or as Rodney Brooks, MIT’s Artificial 
Intelligence Laboratory director, explains, ‘Every time we figure out a piece of

wiping out the human species (The Economist 2020b; Bostrom 2014). Stephen 
Hawking has pronounced to the BBC that ‘the development of full artificial 
intelligence could spell the end of the human race’ (Cellan-Jones 2014, n.p.).  
AI represents profound fears – culminating in our extinction – but also  
profound hopes in bettering life for humanity and life on Earth. 
For these reasons – to ward off our fears and harness AI for betterment – 
the need to continually push for deeper understanding of AI is also corre -
spondingly clear. The current rationalisation of AI persists in human terms, 
as is evident from even the most recent musings on the limitations of AI (The 
Economist 2020a): comparisons are consistently made with human learning 
and cognition, such as ‘embodied cognition’ , or references to the ‘irredeemably 
complex’ nature of human minds (n.p.). In filling the gap of understanding why 
AI is still rubbish at doing elementary tasks that humans accomplish without 
much thinking, such as recognising a stop sign, the current approach appears 
to be to improve machine learning by developing it to resemble human learn-
ing; to write an algorithm that edges ever closer to human cognition, namely, 
achieve the dream of ‘strong’ AI. 
But perhaps that is neither the question to ask, nor the appropriate task at 
hand. What is ultimately still not completely explainable is how algorithms

# Beneficial Applications of Artificial Intelligence

The provided context highlights that artificial intelligence (AI) can supercharge innovation and bring about economic prosperity. AI is utilised in various applications such as improving machine learning techniques, which involves methods that help computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This capability allows AI systems to perform specific tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as voice/image recognition and natural language processing, which are beneficial in everyday life (Kaplan and Haenlein 2019).

Additionally, the context mentions that Stuart Russell emphasises the importance of developing AI systems that serve the objectives of humanity by ensuring their actions align with human goals (Russell 2019). The development must be organised so all members of society can benefit from AI's advancements.
