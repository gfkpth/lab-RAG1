Policymakers and civil society are putting \\ntheir hopes on AI for tackling global challenges such as pandemics and even \\nclimate change (Dobbe and Whittaker 2019; Dananjayan and Raj 2020). AI also \\nseems to be the subject of an arms race between China, Russia and the USA for \\nequipping their armies with automated weaponry (Asaro 2018).\\nWhenever we are confronted with a hype, it is of utmost importance to untan-\\ngle what exactly is at stake and who is behind the discourses and myths created. \\nWe are being told stories about AI as the ultimate innovation, transforming the \\nways we live and work – often started in corporate circles and distributed by \\ntheir supportive popular outlets.

Despite  \\nthe flash of excitement and anxiety that feels so recent, AI itself is not a new  \\nphenomenon. The name Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined in the mid-\\n1950s at a series of academic workshops organised at Dartmouth College, New  \\nHampshire (USA). A group of scientists, led by mathematics professor John \\nMcCarthy, gathered to investigate the ways in which machines could simulate \\naspects of human intelligence: the ability to learn and make decisions. Their \\ncore assumption was that human reasoning could be reconstructed using \\nmathematical techniques and, as a consequence, problem-solving could be  \\nformalised into algorithms (McCarthy et al. 1955/2006).\\nWhat is more recent is a reflexive, if not critical, and social-scientific, under-\\nstanding of not just AI’s capabilities, but its impacts on human life and social \\norganisation (Elliott 2019). It took decades for AI research to move from \\nwhat it could do for us to what it could do to us, or enable us to do to each \\nother. These first critical insights came along with observations that AI can \\nnot only supercharge innovation and bring about economic prosperity but also  \\nlead to inequalities and unfairness. \\nThis book contributes to this debate by critically reflecting on how we  \\nshould think about AI and the relationship between humans and machines.'),\n",

For a concept that has been with us for so \\nlong, there is little consensus on how to define it. The history of debating AI is \\nalmost as old as AI itself. There is more debate than agreement about what AI  \\nis and what it is not, and the only thing generally agreed is that there is no \\nwidely accepted definition (Russell and Norvig 2016). The first definition comes \\nfrom that gathering of scientists in 1955: McCarthy et al. (1955/2006) then \\ndefined AI as: ‘Making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelli -\\ngent if a human were so behaving’ .

Russell and Norvig (2016: 2) define different approaches to  \\nAI to serve different goals. AI can refer to systems that: (1) think like humans; \\n(2) think rationally; (3) act like humans; and (4) act rationally. Each of the \\napproaches requires different disciplinary expertise, thus requiring an inter-, \\nor at least cross-disciplinary discussion. The human-centred approaches will \\ndepart from social science studying human behaviour, while the rationalist \\napproaches will involve a combination of mathematics and engineering. From \\nthe four approaches, acting like humans is closest to how we define and under-\\nstand contemporary AI. \\nWe can see the roots of acting like humans in the Turing test, developed by \\nAlan Turing in 1950. This test, originally designed to provide a satisfactory \\ndefinition of intelligence, has been central to conceptualising AI. According to \\nthe test, if a human interrogator cannot distinguish a machine from a human \\nthrough conversation, then the machine can be considered intelligent. Russell  \\nand Norvig (2016) argue that for a computer to be intelligent – to pass the \\nTuring test – it needs to possess the following capabilities:  natural language \\nprocessing (being able to communicate successfully),  knowledge representation \\n(being able to store what it knows or hears), automated reasoning (being able \\nto use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclu -'),\n",

This can be seen as the attempt \\nto mechanise human-level intelligence. Computer scientists and philosophers \\ndisagree on whether this is at all possible (Coeckelbergh 2020): some directly \\nreject this scenario while others think if theoretically possible, it is not likely to \\nhappen (soon) in practice (Boden 2016). This is why it might be better to focus \\non advancements in weak AI or ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence), as this is \\nthe type of AI already impacting everyday life on a massive scale. Weak/nar -\\nrow AI performs specific tasks which would normally require intelligence in a \\nhuman being – machines aiding human thought and action. This type of AI is a \\nmathematical method for prediction (Agrawal et al. 2018). Such systems can be \\nextremely powerful but are limited in the range of tasks they can perform.\\nRussell and Norvig (2016) see machine learning as a prerequisite for intel -\\nligent machines. Machine learning is a paradigm that allows programs to auto-\\nmatically improve their performance on a particular task by learning from vast \\namounts of data (Alpaydin 2016). It seeks and uses statistical patterns and cor-\\nrelation in enormous datasets.

A basic definition would be to refer to AI as com-\\nputer programming that learns from and adapts to data. A more elaborate ver-\\nsion of this, as Elliott (2019: 4) puts it, defines AI as ‘any computational system \\nthat can sense its relevant context and react intelligently to data’ in order to \\nperform highly complex tasks effectively and to achieve specific goals, thereby \\nmimicking intelligent human behaviours.

We could repeat (and \\nslightly revise) William Gibson’s (2003) seminal quote ‘ AI is already here; it’s \\njust not evenly distributed’ . The question then remains: how can we redistribute \\npower in AI?\\nMy proposal is that if we want to establish AI that transforms society for the \\nbetter and enables human emancipation, we need a radical democratisation of \\nAI. This radical democratisation is necessary to avoid power inequalities, in \\nother words, to avoid a situation whereby only a few organisations, whether \\ngovernmental or corporate, have the economic and political power to decide \\nwhat type of AI will be developed and what purposes it will serve. \\nThis is vital in the data and AI sector, which is characterised by a strong \\ntendency to establish monopolies.

First, AI and \\nthe benefits it offers, should be accessible to everyone. Second, AI and the differ-\\nent services that are being developed should also represent everyone. Third and \\nlast, AI should be beneficial to everyone. These three principles are inspired by \\nthe late Erik Olin Wright’s critique of capitalism. Wright (2019) proposes the \\nprinciples of equality/fairness, democracy/freedom and community/solidar -\\nity as normative foundations for establishing a society that allows its members \\nto live a decent life. In the following paragraphs, I briefly unpack these three  \\nguiding principles.\\n#Principle 1: AI Should Be Accessible to Everyone\\nThis first principle proposes equal access to AI and the benefits it can offer. In \\na decent society, all persons should have broadly equal access to the advan -\\ntages and possibilities being created by digital technologies such as AI. This \\nmeans that we need to make sure that all groups in society have access to and'),\n",

This \\nmeans that we need to make sure that all groups in society have access to and \\ncan use AI. The egalitarian ideal is at the centre of nearly all concepts of social \\njustice, including data justice (Taylor 2017), although there are different opin-\\nions about what it means exactly. An important nuance here is to distinguish \\nbetween equal access and opportunity. The former is chosen over the latter as it \\n‘is a sociologically more appropriate way of understanding the egalitarian ideal’ \\n(Wright 2019, 11). Given the current economic, social and environmental crisis \\nwe are living in, there should be particular attention to intergenerational and \\nenvironmental justice. The first aspect points to the consequences of techno -\\nlogical developments for the future generations, whereas the second aspect asks \\nfor attention for IT and sustainability. This is controversial as AI is both seen \\nas a source of and solution for environmental degradation (Dauvergne 2020).\\n#Principle 2: AI Should Represent Everyone\\nThe second principle is centred around democracy and inclusion. In a decent \\nsociety, all members should have a say about what type of AI is being developed \\nand what services are being offered. The production and implementation of \\nAI must be democratised so that all groups in society are consulted and rep -\\nresented, avoiding exclusion.

Wright (2019) also connects democracy and freedom \\nin order to reflect the value of self-determination. In this sense, members of \\nsociety should be given the possibility to participate meaningfully in decisions \\nthat affect their lives. As AI becomes more omnipresent, people should have \\na say about this. Principles such as fairness, accountability and transparency \\n(ACM 2020) are key when we want technological development not only to  \\nrepresent the people but also guaranteeing control by the people to counterbal-\\nance the power of the state and corporations.\\n#Principle 3: AI Should Be Beneficial to Everyone\\nThe third and last principle states that developments in AI should contribute  \\nto the well-being of everyone in society. This matches with Wright’s (2019) \\nideas of community and solidarity, which are crucial because of their connec -\\ntion to human flourishing and of their role in fostering equality and democracy \\n(see also principles 1 and 2). Central is the idea that if people cooperate, they \\ncan achieve more than if they compete, and cooperation also contributes to the \\nwell-being of all members of society.

The Swedish bank, SEB, e.g., developed AIDA, an AI-\\ndriven virtual assistant responding to a vast range of customers’ queries, such \\nas how to make overseas payments or how to proceed when opening a bank \\naccount. AIDA is even capable of detecting a customer’s mood by the tone of \\nher or his voice and adapting its recommendations and suggestions thereto. In \\naround 30% of situations, AIDA is not able to respond or help. In this case, the \\ncustomer is transferred to a human. AIDA ’s implementation freed up human \\nemployees’ time, which they then use for more complex demands, i.e., the 30% \\nthat exceeded AIDA ’s limitations.\\nA study by Wilson and Daugherty (2018, 117) suggested that it is in com -\\npanies’ interest not to replace employees with AI, as this would not be a long-\\nterm strategy. Looking at 1,500 corporations, they identified the best improve-\\nments in performance when machines and human beings work together, and \\nconcluded: ‘Through such collaborative intelligence, humans and AI actively \\nenhance each other’s complementary strengths: the leadership, teamwork, cre-\\nativity, and social skills of the former, and the speed, scalability, and quantita -'),\n",

Is humanism out-\\ndated and can it be renounced? Or does it only need an update? And if so, an \\nupdate in which direction? \\nThere is discussion abound with pros and cons concerning technological, \\nmilitary, sociological and philosophical aspects of AI, Trans- and Post Human-\\nism (Hofkirchner and Kreowski 2020). And there is a candidate for updating \\nhumanism – Digital Humanism. \\nThis term popped up in a Gartner Special Report published in April 2015. \\nThe report had the title ‘Digital Business: Digital Humanism Makes People Bet-\\nter, Not Technology Better’ and its summary makes clear what Digital Human-\\nism was supposed to be about and what it is was not supposed to be about: \\n‘Digital humanism is the recognition that digital business revolves around \\npeople, not technology.

The level of algorithmic processing \\ntoday presents two tensions which hinder a full comprehension of creative AI. \\nThe first is the still formidable lack of transparency of AI’s workings, as noted \\nby many scholars à la the algorithmic ‘black box’ (Pasquale 2015; Diakopoulos \\n2016; Brill 2015; Ananny and Crawford 2018).

This level of processing may be contrasted with \\nhow computers had previously produced creative work, or in what is known as \\nautomated creativity. As early as the 1950s, computers have produced creative \\noutputs, such as music, by running codes of basic material and stylistic param-\\neters which enabled the generating of ‘raw materials’ . These musical ‘materi -\\nals’ were then modified and assembled by human composers into recognisable \\npieces of music (Alpern 1995). In these cases, the computer was specifically pro-\\ngrammed to produce the creative output , following instructions on where and \\nhow to place notes or dabs of paint, even if those instructions may be rules of \\nrandomness.1 The research field of Computational Creativity recognises such \\nprogramming as ‘pastiche’ , where the computer’s creativity is a ‘mere appear-'),\n",

Machine learning can only learn from past data and \\nit’s pretty clear that means a perpetuation of existing biases. This collision of AI \\nwith civil rights has led to corrective efforts at both technical and ethical lev -\\nels (Feldman et al. 2015), (High-Level Expert Group on AI 2019). Meanwhile, \\nother observers have pointed out the ways that AI adds its own asymmetries \\nto an already skewed social landscape (Eubanks 2018). There’s more data about \\nthe poor and marginalised because they are already most surveilled, and they \\nare most surveilled because our social systems already categorise them as trou-\\nblesome. As a result, any unfairness that algorithms add to the mix will fall \\nmore heavily on those who are already struggling the most. However, it’s not \\nonly or even mainly data that shapes the politics of AI.\\nLangdon Winner wrote about the way particular technologies appear to \\nhave an inherent compatibility with particular socio-political systems (Winner \\n2020), so it’s fair to ask what feedback loops connect AI and the societies into'),\n",

For the purposes of this chapter it is impor -\\ntant to ask these questions not only to provide a bigger picture of the problems \\nof AI, but to predict the problematic nature of the likely reaction to it. The con-\\ntention is that a reactive if understandable response to the harms caused by AI \\nwill itself risk feeding into wider crises instead of escaping them. The first step \\nin unpacking this is to be more concrete about AI and about the resonances \\nthat are set up between its mathematical logic and its action in the world.\\nThe Logic of AI\\nActual AI is a form of machine learning; that is, an approach to computational \\nproblem-solving that iterates to a solution using data. It’s different to more \\ntraditional forms of computational modelling: instead of trying to simulate the  \\ninner workings of a system, it’s a transferable method of number crunching that \\nsimply requires sufficiently large amounts of training data. It’s also different  \\nto traditional statistics, although it branches off from that family tree – where \\nstatistics tries to assess very precisely the relationships between variables and \\nthe robustness and possible error in the parameters, machine learning really \\ndoesn’t care – its only goal is to make repeatable predictions.

In some of his stories, nobody knows exactly how \\nthose technical objects work or how they have been constructed, they just use \\nthem and are happy doing so.\\nIn today’s specialised society with a division of labour, most people also do \\nnot understand most of the technology they use. However, this is not a serious \\nproblem, since for each technology there are specialists who understand, ana -\\nlyse and improve the products in their field of work – unlike in Clarke’s worlds. \\nBut since they are experts in few areas and human lifetime is limited, they are,'),\n",

AI applications are offered free to consumers and end-users in products \\nsuch as Google Maps in exchange for access to vast amounts of data (Zuboff  \\n2019). While AI has the potential to be used for many socially beneficial pur -\\nposes, there is concern about dangerous and problematic uses of the technol -\\nogy, which has prompted a global conversation on the normative principles \\nto which AI ought adhere, under the banner of ‘ AI ethics’ . Governments, cor-\\nporations and NGOs throughout the world have generated their own sets of \\nAI ethics principles. Questions and critiques arise about the content of these \\nethics principles, whether they are actually implemented, and their (legal) \\nenforceability (Wagner 2018). Broader issues emerge about the power and \\nprivilege of the organisations, governments and individuals which are creat -\\ning and implementing AI and accompanying ethical principles. For example,'),\n",

A \\nhybrid theory allows respect for cultural diversity and demands case-by-case \\ndeterminations of goodness and systematic values and standards.

I argue that existing considerations of the recon -\\nfiguration of AI have primarily focused on utility and have largely neglected \\nquestions of feasibility. Feasibility is considered primarily in relation to the \\nmateriality of AI, or its concrete aspects which ‘set constraints on and offer \\naffordances for use’ (Leonardi and Barley 2008, 171). By attending to the \\nmateriality of AI we can see how it differs from traditional, industrial means  \\nof production.\\nThe chapter first discusses the contemporary form of AI called machine \\nlearning and its increasing importance to the tech industry. Then I discuss sev-\\neral aspects of its materiality. Next, I discuss Marxist theories of technology \\nand existing evaluations of reconfiguring AI, which focus primarily on utility.  \\nThen I turn to the question of feasibility. I conclude that the social reconfig -\\nuration of AI faces substantial difficulties posed by the lack of visibility and  \\nnon-modularity of AI, but that some promise is to be derived from the data \\ncommons movement. I suggest that further research on socially reconfiguring \\ntechnology should focus more on feasibility, rather than utility and can begin \\nby looking at concrete ways to resist the impositions of AI capital.\\nMachine Learning Materiality\\nIndustry\\nEarly approaches to AI attempted to automate high-level logical reasoning rep-'),\n",

Such approaches to AI are called ‘symbolic’ or \\n‘good old-fashioned’ AI (Haugeland 1989) and have largely been overshadowed \\nby a different approach to AI known as machine learning. Machine learning is \\noften anthropomorphised, but it is at base the use of statistical methods, called \\nlearning algorithms, to find patterns in large datasets. On the basis of these pat-\\nterns an algorithm called a ‘model’ is produced which may be used to analyse \\nnew data (Alpaydin 2014, 2–3). A model thus represents ‘knowledge’ of the pat-\\nterns found by the learning algorithm and can be used to make useful analyses \\nor predictions.

What is becoming clear is that world leaders are invested in making AI \\nthe business opportunity of the future – and thereby selling it as a virtue and a \\npublic good (Economist 2017, 2018; World Economic Forum 2018). \\nScholars in political economy of communication have shown how discourses \\naround digital technologies have historically been constructed around modern \\nmyths (Mosco 2004) with major references to utopian worlds and possibili -\\nties. Myths, conceived as the dominant ideologies of our time (Barthes 1993) \\nbecome powerful devices that normalise conventional wisdom into ‘common \\nsense’ (Gramsci 1971), thus making the conception of alternatives virtually \\nimpossible. As a result, digital developments and policies are adopted without \\nthe benefit of an informed debate (Brevini 2020).'),\n",

Member states pledged to work together towards ‘a comprehensive and \\nintegrated European approach on AI’ (EU Declaration 2018). The declaration \\nwas followed by two communications reports by High-Level Expert groups \\non AI (High-Level Expert Group 2019); and a White Paper was published in  \\nFebruary 2020.\\nThis chapter aims to unwrap the recurrent myths employed in discourses \\non AI in Europe. In doing so, this work aims to embrace a research agenda \\nthat integrates political economy (Mosco 2004; Fuchs 2015; McChesney 2013) \\nwith cultural analysis, thus considering the idea of myth and mythmaking as an \\nessential dimension of inquiry. \\nWhy Dominant Discourses Are Crucial\\nThat technology discourses have a central role in the legitimation of a specific \\npolitical economic order has been at the centre of scholarship debates for some \\ntime (Mosco 2004; Freedman 2002; Brevini 2020).

Accord-\\ning to Barthes, myths have the ability to construct ‘common sense’ , thus favour-\\ning established relations of power. But it was Gramsci (1971) who provided \\nthe crucial link between common sense and discourse. For Gramsci, myths are \\nessentially common sense, defined as ‘not something rigid and immobile, but \\n… continually transforming itself, enriching itself with scientific ideas and with \\nphilosophical opinions that have entered ordinary life. Common sense creates \\nthe folklore of the future, that is a relatively rigid phase of popular knowledge \\nat a given place and time. ’ (Gramsci 1971, 326). Through this process, the val-\\nues of powerful elites are naturalised, becoming the default position against \\nwhich, all things are assessed and compared. Thus, myths, here conceptualised \\nas common sense can influence and shape discourse and policy making in way \\nthat, as Wyatt notes: ‘sometimes today’s imaginary becomes tomorrow’s lived \\nreality’ (Wyatt 2004, 244).

Summar-\\nily, the task at hand was to write an intelligent computer program; one that \\ncould simulate human thinking, and while at it, why not, properly think and \\neven be conscious, just like a human. They had just realised that computers \\nwere able to handle arithmetical and logical operations much better than an \\nordinary human being, and a whole wide world of opportunities opened up \\nbefore them. But after some initial effort, the researchers saw two things: the \\naim of implementing intelligence was an ill-posed problem, because there \\nwas no satisfactory definition of intelligence. The concept of intelligence, just \\nlike many defining characteristic of human beings, is normative and vague.  \\nThe second realisation would come a little later, as it required more failures: the  \\ninternal dynamics of many human endeavours were unknown, and misjudged. \\nPeople thought that understanding and speaking was easy, whereas playing \\nchess was difficult. Thus, chess was seen as a benchmark of intelligence.

Alan Turing, in his classical essay ‘Computing Machinery \\nand Intelligence’ proposed an imitation game, where a computer chats with a \\nperson and passes the game if it can keep up the appearance (of being human) \\nfor about five minutes (Turing 1950). Turing’s expectations of the future of \\ncomputers was quite close to the mark: \\nThe original question, ‘Can machines think?’ I believe to be too mean -\\ningless to deserve discussion. Nevertheless I believe that at the end of \\nthe century the use of words and general educated opinion will have \\naltered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking \\nwithout expecting to be contradicted. (Turing 1950, 442) \\nIn 1980, John Searle wrote the most controversial critique of artificial intel -\\nligence. His famous Chinese room argument is as follows: suppose there is a \\nroom with two small slots, and a person within it. One of the slots is used to \\npass this person little pieces of paper with Chinese characters on it. There is \\nalso a rulebook in the room that tells the person inside what kind of symbols'),\n",

The response \\n‘squoggles’ are put through the second slot. Although the symbol exchange \\ncan be seen as a perfectly normal conversation for a person who understands  \\nChinese, the person in the room does not know Chinese. Having consciousness \\nand simulating one are different for Searle, and no machine will ever think, it \\ncan just simulate, or act as if it is thinking (Searle 1980, 355). \\nThe responses to Searle are numerous (Harnad 1989), and the debate con -\\ntinued for about ten years. What interests me here is not the debate itself, but \\nrather its emphasis on intentionality. For philosophers of language, what is \\nmeant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning. \\nSearle argues that a computer simulation, no matter how good it is, will never \\nproject more than its programmer’s intentions, i.e. a computer program can \\nnever have intentions (and mental states), because it is written according to \\nsome syntactical rules, and it lacks the connections to semantic access. If such \\nwritten programs can fool us into believing that they are intelligent beings, \\nthis does not prove that these programs are operating on the semantic level; it \\nonly shows that we are deceived by the programmer’s ghost, which acts like a \\nremote-control system through the program. \\nAt the end, Searle’s approach comes down to a simple point: an inorganic'),\n",

I think that \\nthere is some truth in Hofstadter’s claim; after all, a search for a human soul in \\na digital computer, even if it is run under the name as ‘intentionality/conscious-\\nness’ is suggestive enough for a belief in body/mind distinction.

He was greatly interested in cybernetics and information theory, and his \\nattempts to make use of these concepts in art theory gave the impetus and the \\nright climate for scientists like Nees and Nake to publish their works as art. \\nBense’s objective was to use computer generated pictures for finding ‘quan -\\ntitative measures of the aesthetics of objects’ (Candy and Edmonds 2002, 8). \\nSoon after the first exhibitions, Nees became a student of Bense, and wrote his \\ndissertation entitled ‘Generative Computer Graphics’ . The thesis most notably \\nincluded several highly principled computer programs to generate graphical \\noutput, based on Bense’s ideas as outlined in his book Aesthetica (Nees 1969; \\nBense 1965). \\nComputer art relied on two mechanisms in the beginning: the artist’s inten-\\ntions, and the use of computer, respectively.

The first order comprises those simulacra which are natural -\\nist, counterfeit images of reality that still ‘aim for the restitution or the ideal \\ninstitution of nature made in God’s image’ (Baudrillard 1994, 121). In the pre-\\nIndustrial Age, the nature of being, as inspired by God, defined natural reality \\nand universal truth. The second order of simulacra are materialised as prod -\\nucts, made possible by the advanced machinations of the Industrial Age, which \\ngenerated the expansion of globalisation.

While algorithms are nothing particularly new \\nand can be closely related to computing or even mathematics as such, debates \\nhave slowly but surely moved beyond the narrow confines of the so-called hard \\nsciences. They are now taking centre stage when authors analyse topics such \\nas political communication, electoral campaigning and mass micro-targeting \\nof potential voters (Moore 2018; Vaidhyanathan 2018), automated trading in \\nstock markets and various other types of financial transactions (Pasquale 2015, \\nCh. 4; MacKenzie 2017; 2018), or the impact of technological innovations on \\njournalism (Diakopoulos 2019). Their influence is emphasised in healthcare, \\nloan approvals, transportation, traffic-control, city urbanization, education, \\nemployment, policing, security and even military conflicts (Fisher 2020; Bridle  \\n2018; Moore 2018; Munn 2018; Mosco 2014).

There seems to be little doubt algorithms now play one of the \\ncentral roles in almost all spheres of society, from politics and economy to cul-\\nture and interpersonal relationships, subsequently raising various types of ethi-\\ncal issues (Mittelstadt et al. 2016; Coeckelbergh 2020).\\nIn digital environments algorithms overlap and mutually influence each \\nother, forming what can be considered layered algorithmic systems or ensem-\\nbles of algorithms (cf. Kitchin 2017, 18–21). In this chapter I will not explain \\nindividual algorithms in an abstract manner, but rather focus on the key char-\\nacteristics and social consequences of such ensembles of algorithms in their \\ncurrent hegemonic social form (for practical reasons I will simply refer to  \\nthem as algorithms). This will hopefully shed some light on the reasons for \\ntheir increasing social influence.\\nAll technologies are inevitably embedded in – and influenced by – the social \\ncontext in which they are developed, so my analysis will consider ensembles of \\nalgorithms as part of the competitive and inherently unstable capitalist society'),\n",

My contribution therefore aims to provide some \\nanswers on how algorithms work in digital capitalism, what are the key rea -\\nsons for this and what is their impact for society at large. Focusing on digital \\ncapitalism assumes a theoretical framework of the political economy of com -\\nmunication, which points at the power asymmetries in society in an overarch-\\ning manner, while taking on board the fact there is nothing ‘natural’ in these \\ncharacteristics of algorithms. It also helps to move the analysis beyond abstract \\nnotions that have a limited explanatory value in specific historical contexts.\\nUnderstanding Ensembles of Algorithms in Capitalism\\nIn contrast to many other topics there is a large degree of overlapping in how \\nauthors define algorithms. Bunz (2014, 7), for example, notes that an algorithm \\nis ‘a set of rules to be followed by calculations’ . This definition does not dif -\\nfer significantly from either Bucher’s (2017, 31), in which an algorithm ‘is just \\nanother term for those carefully planned instructions that follow a sequential \\norder’ , or Kitchin’s (2017, 14), for whom algorithms are ‘sets of defined steps'),\n",

Even though they were put forward by social scientists, such \\ndefinitions are quite abstract and cannot explain by themselves why the social \\nimpact of algorithms has been so significant in recent years, especially since \\nthere is no inherent technical necessity for their increased omnipresence.'),\n",

It \\nis exactly these algorithms, however, that are most influential and consequen -\\ntial.

In essence, how algorithms actu -\\nally operate is to a large degree incomprehensible and difficult to understand, \\noften even for experts. While we have basic ideas about the major algorithms, \\ndiscerning details of how exactly they work, what data they are collecting, \\nhow it is used, why certain results finally appear, or who has access to them, \\nis much more difficult or even impossible. Pasquale (2015), for example, notes \\nthat algorithms are secretive and restrictive black boxes. This seems like an \\napt metaphor, since it denotes both a recording device and ‘a system whose \\nworkings are mysterious; we can observe its inputs and outputs, but we cannot  \\ntell how one becomes the other’ (ibid. 3). Even though algorithms have wide-\\nranging consequences for the shape and direction of our societies, this means \\nthey are ‘opaque and inaccessible to outside critique; and their parameters, \\nintent and assumptions indiscernible’ (Willson 2016, 4).\\nThere are three major structural reasons for this characteristic.

Law enforcement agencies mostly rely on FR for two purposes: face \\nverification to confirm a claimed identity and face identification to ‘identify an \\nunknown face’ (Garvie, Bedoya and Frankle 2016, 10).\\nAlthough both are contentious, it is the latter application that has raised the \\nmost eyebrows. Back in 2016, the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Tech-\\nnology reported that FBI searches for identity using FR were ‘more common \\nthan federal court-ordered wiretaps’ (Garvie, Bedoya and Frankle 2016, 25). \\nThe faces of nearly 117 million Americans were already in federal law enforce-\\nment databases and every other American adult had had their photos searched \\nin this manner. Law enforcement agencies in the United States have dabbled in \\nFR-based surveillance projects since 2001 (Gates 2011). Now, with advances \\nin technology, police departments in various cities in the US, in conjunction \\nwith technology corporations, have initiated FR-based surveillance programs \\nthat use existing infrastructure like CCTV cameras such as Detroit’s Project \\nGreenlight, under which ‘cameras all over the city keep an eye on the popu -\\nlace’ (Colaner 2020). Others are experimenting with using FR on body cameras \\nand mobile phones (Naughton 2020).

The  \\nfirst is the inaccuracy of the technology itself, or the possibility that an individ-\\nual is not who the FR algorithm identifies them as. That is because ‘biometric \\nrecognition is an inherently probabilistic endeavour’ (Pato and Millett 2010, 9).  \\nFR technology doesn’t see faces – the way humans do – but offers probable \\nmatches based on geometric representations of facial features.

At first, the algo -\\nrithm is trained to recognise which facial features are more likely than others \\nto indicate similarity by analysing different images of the same person from a \\nlarge training data set. This is known as machine learning. It then applies this \\nlearning to identify images of the same individual in real-life law-enforcement \\nscenarios (Huang et al. 2008). But this machine learning involves ‘millions of \\nvariables’ – such as lighting, picture quality, and subject distance, for example \\n– and is never perfect (Garvie, Bedoya and Frankle 2016).

This happens in two ways. One, law enforcement agencies collect \\nphoto graphs of people to populate their FR databases – and they do so indis -\\ncriminately.

So far, these pho -\\ntographs have been mined from people’s driving licences, ID cards and even \\nsocial media accounts. As FR is employed via cameras at airports, on police \\npersonnel and so on, people will be subjected to facial ‘tracking from far away, \\nin secret’ and en masse (10). This makes it nearly impossible for people to man-\\nage their boundaries, a key practice in maintaining dynamic privacy relation -\\nships. This, in turn, makes it difficult to practice critical citizenship and aspire \\nto the ideals of liberal democracy (Cohen 2012).\\nTwo, a significant feature of ‘high-dimensional’ – or individualised – data \\ncollection is that it allows cross referencing of multiple data sets (boyd and  \\nCrawford 2012).

The social dis -\\ncourse lost its biopolitical magnitude – and so did the bill.\\nShahin (2019) has drawn attention to the theoretical significance of ‘critical \\njunctures’ – emergent conditions in which a social discourse takes on a new \\ndirection without the principal stakeholders intending it to – in shaping regu-\\nlations about technology. The ACLU experiment in August 2019 was such a \\ncritical juncture in the discourse about AB-1215. Even though ACLU’s own \\nposition on why FR had no place in law enforcement did not shift after the \\nexperiment – its press releases, for instance, retained their focus on systemic \\nissues – both Assembly member Ting and the media latched on to Rekogni -'),\n",

Scholars and \\nactivists have long been aware of the role of algorithms and artificial intelli -\\ngence in marginalising minorities and immigrants and reinforcing relations of \\npower (boyd and Crawford 2012; Eubanks 2018). Biometric technologies, such \\nas FR, are particularly insidious examples as they can act at the level of both \\nthe ‘body’ and the ‘body politic’ . They reduce human beings into data points \\nthat may be stored, manipulated and controlled en masse (Browne 2010; Hood \\n2020). At the same time, they enable forms of domination that are systemic in \\nnature: they have a long history and they are institutionalised in a variety of \\nsocial practices. Indeed, algorithms themselves represent one such social prac-\\ntice. The prejudices they exhibit are a consequence of the systemic bias they are \\nproduced by – even as the algorithms help re-enact and reproduce that bias. \\nResearch on and resistance to algorithmic governance should, therefore, avoid \\nthe trap of technological determinism and not lose sight of the systemic nature \\nof their subject matter – the biopolitics of discrimination and domination. \\nReferences\\nACLU. 2019a.

But it is less ironic than perverse to see that part of the profit of \\none of the owners of Cloud Empire (Couldry and Mejias 2019) is related to the \\ncrowd work of millions of workers around the world. \\nThe slogan also reveals the simplistic nature of the debates about the future \\nof work and artificial intelligence (AI) that carry persistent representations of a \\n‘general artificial intelligence’ driven by Hollywood imagery. These discourses \\npoint to visions of AI playing a key role in the full automation of work, whether \\nin positive or negative frameworks (Dyer-Witheford, Kjosen and Steinhoff 2019).\\nThese narratives make inequalities and ghost work (Gray and Suri 2019) \\ninvisible, even though crowdsourced labour performed by humans, in fact, \\nsupports AI.

This helps to consoli-\\ndate images of digital labour, AI and data among workers (Soriano and Cabanes \\n2019; Beer 2019).\\nWork behind artificial intelligence is called ‘ghost work’ (Gray and Suri 2019), \\n‘clickwork’ (Casilli 2019) and ‘micro-work’ (Tubaro and Casilli 2019; Lehdon-\\nvirta 2016). These metaphors are attempts to name work activities on AI plat -\\nforms. They are not definitive notions, but just illustrations. For instance, the \\nfact that this work consists of individual, compartmentalised ‘tasks’ lasting per-\\nhaps only seconds or minutes, does not make it ‘micro’ . In a similar way, these \\nworkers do more than just click on ads. On the one hand, the multiplicity of \\ntasks involves audio transcriptions and translations, describing images, record-\\ning videos and photos, and so on. On the other hand, we understand that work \\nactivities, whatever they may be, involve the entire (material) body of workers \\n(Huws 2014).\\nWhatever the name, these people work for global artificial intelligence plat -\\nforms.

However, as Srnicek (2016) argues, \\nthere is not just one type of platform. The role of algorithms and data in \\nplatform labour depends on its mechanisms and ways of extracting value  \\n(Sadowski 2020). In the case of AI, platforms are the places for many workers \\nto produce and circulate data to automate processes, that is, towards AI (Beer \\n2016, 2019). Ghost work behind AI is a way of mining workers’ process for data \\n(Neff, McGrath and Prakash 2020).

These \\ntransformations are often simultaneously touted as enhancing forms of effi -\\nciency and better decision-making at the same time as presenting significant \\nsocietal challenges. The question of jobs and the changing nature of work has \\nbeen one prominent area where AI is said to have dramatic implications. Work-\\ners are subjected to evermore data collection about not just their activities at \\nwork, but beyond factors related to work. At the same time, machine learning \\nsystems are using this data to transform how work is being allocated, assessed \\nand completed. Often it is these two components – data collection and machine \\nlearning – that is referred to under the banner of AI (Sánchez-Monedero and \\nDencik 2019).

Labour concerns have predominantly \\nfocused on the immediate threat of job losses and changing forms of work, \\nbut these have rarely been translated into AI governance debates more broadly. \\nInstead, we have seen governance frameworks emerge that centre on questions \\nof individual rights, data protection, ethics and fairness, privileging citizen \\nand consumer rights over workers’ rights. These frameworks tend to engage \\nat a level of abstract principles that centre on the nature of technology rather \\nthan the conditions of injustice in which technology is situated, and struggle \\nto account for AI as an outcome of power dynamics and interests that serve to \\nshape social relations. The absence of labour perspectives within these debates, \\nand voices that extrapolate from workplace struggles to a wider engagement \\nwith AI in the context of advanced capitalism, is therefore a significant gap in \\nthe context of what we might refer to as data justice; an understanding of data-\\nfication in relation to social justice (Dencik, Hintz and Cabel 2016). \\nIn this chapter, I argue for the need for ‘data justice unionism’ , a form of \\nsocial justice unionism that engages with data-centric technologies as firmly'),\n",

These have \\ntended to exclude broader labour concerns and often frame what is at stake \\nwith AI in terms of trade-offs between economic gains and individual rights \\nthat bypass an engagement with collective rights and more fundamental ques-\\ntions about the political economy of AI. I then go on to discuss key issues in \\nAI that a labour perspective foregrounds, in the workplace and beyond, before \\nsituating these in relation to data justice unionism. As a component of social  \\njustice unionism that argues for unions working in coalition with other  \\nsocial movements to advance a more just society, data justice unionism makes \\nan explicit connection between digital rights and socio-economic rights and \\ncontends with AI in the context of labour relations under capitalism.

Part 2, Discourses and Myths about AI, \\nexcavates metaphors and policies to ask normative questions about what \\nis ‘desirable’ AI and what conditions make this possible. Part 3, AI Power \\nand Inequalities, discusses how the implementation of AI creates important \\nchallenges that urgently need to be addressed.\\nBringing together scholars from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and \\nregional contexts, this book offers a vital intervention on one of the most \\nhyped concepts of our times.\\nTHE EDITOR\\nPIETER VERDEGEM is Senior Lecturer in Media Theory in the Westminster School of'),\n",

Despite  \\nthe flash of excitement and anxiety that feels so recent, AI itself is not a new  \\nphenomenon. The name Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined in the mid-\\n1950s at a series of academic workshops organised at Dartmouth College, New  \\nHampshire (USA). A group of scientists, led by mathematics professor John \\nMcCarthy, gathered to investigate the ways in which machines could simulate \\naspects of human intelligence: the ability to learn and make decisions. Their \\ncore assumption was that human reasoning could be reconstructed using \\nmathematical techniques and, as a consequence, problem-solving could be  \\nformalised into algorithms (McCarthy et al. 1955/2006).\\nWhat is more recent is a reflexive, if not critical, and social-scientific, under-\\nstanding of not just AI’s capabilities, but its impacts on human life and social \\norganisation (Elliott 2019). It took decades for AI research to move from \\nwhat it could do for us to what it could do to us, or enable us to do to each \\nother. These first critical insights came along with observations that AI can \\nnot only supercharge innovation and bring about economic prosperity but also  \\nlead to inequalities and unfairness. \\nThis book contributes to this debate by critically reflecting on how we  \\nshould think about AI and the relationship between humans and machines.'),\n",

It seeks and uses statistical patterns and cor-\\nrelation in enormous datasets.
